# proc_life_v0.2
 This is my work in progress game based on the following idea:
 - What if the entire story, including characters, locations, items, and quests were 
   generated in a JSON format by a chatbot so it can be processed into a working
   text-based adventure game?
 - What if the conversations and all the descriptions in the game were AI-generated?

 The game is rendered in a retro style as if you are typing into a terminal window to 
 progress the story, and it includes a separate inventory and map view.
